# Objective

This subdirectory is primary for my solutions to cracking the coding interview
questions. Some are sloppy, untested, and not ideal, but they are written in 
paper or using vim without the searching answers.

# My Tips and rules for writing code (WIP)

  1. A compiler, auto-completer, highlighters are crutches. Use them sparingly.

  2. Act as the compiler before running anything. If you can catch them before
    the interview can you have done a great job.
  
  3. Learn principles, methods and rules of thumb are intermediate steps to mastery

  4. Grapple with problems before ever google something
  
  5. Understand > Diagram > Pseudocode > Code, get in the habit


# CTCI Tips for coding interviews

  1. Write code on paper or a simplified text editor (vi, vim, etc.)
  
  2. Don't memorize solutions

  3. Talk Out Loud


Some quotes from the book:


"Thorough preparation will give you a wide range of technical and communication
skills. It will be well-worth it no matter where the effort takes you!"

"To crack the coding interview, you need to prepare with _real_ interview questions.
You must practice on real problems, and learn their patterns."

"[...] they _are_ looking to see how well you would fit with the team, and how you 
would affect team chemistry. If they hire you, you're all going to be spending a
lot of time together for the next few months or years, and they want to know that
they can rely on you-- and maybe even come to consider you a friend and colleague."

"They know that it's better to reject a good candidate than hire a bad one."
